# Fifth problem 

## Do in Linux

- Create a user named javed on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-01-28, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

## Solution

 `useradd anita -e <DATE>`
 
- -e for expiry
To verify we can check `chage -l <username>`
